# Sentinel Policy Set Example
A quick repo to hold test policies for AWS resources

The repo includes common functions, AWS and also custom policies cloned here from [Pedro's great repo](https://github.com/Pedro-Hashicorp/terraform-sentinel-policies/tree/main).

There are different `sentinel.hcl` file examples to be applied in both a [./development](development) and a [./production](production) workspaces to demonstrate how to apply different policies from a single policy set repo.
